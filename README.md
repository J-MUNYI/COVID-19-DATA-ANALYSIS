# COVID-19-DATA-ANALYSIS
## Project Title:
COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Short Description:
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to understand trends, identify high-risk regions, and visualize the pandemic's progression over time using interactive plots and statistical summaries.

## Objectives of the Project:
Load and clean real-world COVID-19 data.

Analyze key metrics like total cases, new cases, and deaths.

Visualize trends over time and across countries.

Communicate data-driven insights clearly and effectively.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
Python (programming language)

Pandas – data loading and manipulation

Matplotlib – basic plotting

Seaborn – advanced visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – interactive code and narrative writing

## How to Run/View the Project:
Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells step-by-step.

Ensure you have an internet connection to load the dataset from the URL.

Visualizations and insights will be generated automatically as the notebook runs.

## Insights or Reflections:
Countries with large populations tend to report higher case counts, though not always proportionally.

The virus had multiple global spikes, often linked to new variants or policy shifts.

Visualizations helped reveal trends that aren't obvious in raw data (e.g., continent-level comparisons).

Clean and well-commented code made the analysis reproducible and easy to update with new data.
